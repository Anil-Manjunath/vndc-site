VISHWAKIRAN NAMBI\nContemporary Dance Artist, Choreographer\n, Dance Academic, Dance Film Maker and Creative\n Director, \nVishwakiran\n \nNambi\n Dance Company & Loka Studio for Movement Practices Bangalore, India\nPROFESSIONAL SUMMARY\nDistinguished contemporary dance artist, choreographer, and dance film maker with two decades of practice based in Bangalore, India. Recipient of the prestigious Uday Shankar Choreography Award. Known for innovative cross-disciplinary work combining traditional Indian dance forms with contemporary movement practices and technology.\nVishwakiran\n \nNambi\n: Pioneering Modern Indian Dance \nThrough\n Social Innovation\nAt the forefront of India's contemporary dance revolution stands \nVishwakiran\n \nNambi\n, a visionary choreographer who has redefined the boundaries between traditional Indian movement arts and modern expression. Based in Bengaluru, his groundbreaking work represents a bold new direction in Modern Indian Dance, where social consciousness meets artistic innovation, and community development intertwines with creative excellence.\nAs a trailblazer in the field, \nVishwakiran's\n journey from Principal Dancer at \nNritarutya\n to an acclaimed choreographer and filmmaker exemplifies his commitment to pushing artistic boundaries. His revolutionary approach to dance filmmaking began with "The Kitchen," a multi-award winning short film that challenged conventional narratives in Indian dance cinema. This was followed by a series of powerful works—"Pyre," "\nYele\n Oota," and "\nJaaga\n \nIlla\n"—each piece breaking new ground in how Modern Indian Dance addresses contemporary social issues. Through these works, he has created a unique artistic language that speaks to beauty, discrimination, anthropology, and politics, making him one of the most compelling voices in South Asian contemporary dance.\nIn 2018, \nVishwakiran's\n innovative spirit led to the establishment of the \nVishwakiran\n \nNambi\n Dance Company (VNDC), a pioneering institution that has become a crucible for experimental dance in India. VNDC stands as a testament to his vision of integrating dance filmmaking, movement art training, and artistic curation into a cohesive force for social change. The company has become a laboratory for Modern Indian Dance, where traditional forms are respectfully reimagined through a contemporary lens.\nThe founding of LOKA Studio for Movement Practices in the same year marked another milestone in his mission to democratize dance. More than a training \ncenter\n, LOKA has evolved into a movement incubator where artistic innovation meets community building. By making sophisticated movement arts accessible to practitioners of all levels, \nVishwakiran\n has created a new model for dance \neducation\n in India—one that breaks down traditional barriers while nurturing both artistic excellence and social consciousness.\nHis introduction of Aerial Silk training to Bangalore\n,\n showcases his commitment to expanding the vocabulary of Indian movement arts. This initiative has grown exponentially, reaching nearly \n4,0\n00 students across multiple \ncenters\n and cities, creating a new generation of aerial artists in South India. Through this program, he has not only introduced a new movement discipline but has also created employment opportunities and professional pathways in the performing arts sector.\nAs a community builder and artistic innovator, \nVishwakiran\n has created a sustainable ecosystem for dance in South India. His work goes beyond performance and training—it's about building bridges between different art forms, between artists and audiences, and between traditional and \ncontemporary expressions. Through VNDC and LOKA, he has established platforms that nurture not just dancers, but creative thinkers who use movement as a medium for social change.\nHis ongoing contributions to Modern Indian Dance represent a vision where artistic excellence serves as a catalyst for social transformation. Through his multifaceted approach to dance innovation—spanning stage, screen, and studio—\nVishwakiran\n \nNambi\n continues to shape the future of Indian dance while building communities and creating opportunities for the next generation of artists.\nCURRENT POSITIONS\nFounder & Artistic Director, \nVishwakiran\n \nNambi\n Dance Company\nDirector, Loka Studio for Movement Practices\nHead of Dance, BVoc Program at Jyoti Nivas University, Bangalore\nDance Academic and Choreographer\nNOTABLE ARTISTIC ACHIEVEMENTS\nFormer Lead dancer, Head of training and Choreographer at \nNritarutya\n Dance Company (10 years)\nOriginal Productions & Choreography\nEXORDIUM - Full-length contemporary dance theatre production (Director & Choreographer)\n, 2023\n"The Kitchen" - Award-winning dance film (Director)\n, 2019\n"Pyre" - Multi-festival contemporary dance work (Choreographer)\n, 2018\n"Stone Unturned" \n–\n \nFull length \nSolo \nrepertoire\n integrating projection mapping technology with dance, performed at "Adhyaya"\n, 2016\n"Dreamz" \n–\n Solo\n work\n / Projection mapping and New media, 2015\nJogwa\n, Facets, Peacock, Askew, Wild Flower – Short contemporary pieces Choreography for the core company of \nNritarutya\n Dance Company – 2009 to 2019\nChreographed\n multiple short pieces for \nNritarutya\n dance company for their commercial  events- 2009 to 2019\nFilm & Commercial Work\nMovement Director for theatrical production "Limbo" (Dir.
