Philosophy:\nArt brea\nthes where breath itself begins, \nnot in galleries or stages, but in the quiet reverence of hands that arrange flowers, in the intuitive choreography of a chef's movements, in the patient alchemy of brewing tea. We believe in the sacred democracy of aesthetic experience, where the vendor's eye for \ncolor\n harmony and the artisan's understanding of form speak the same ancient language as any masterwork.\nThere exists an unbroken thread connecting al\nl acts of creation and curation, \na continuous weaving where the boundary between artist and audience dissolves. The same impulse that drives a painter to canvas guides the florist's selection, the same rhythm that moves a dancer pulses through the preparation of a meal. These are not separate worlds but facets of a singular human capacity for transforming the ordinary into the meaningful.\nWe seek to \nhonor\n this interconnectedness, recognizing that aesthetic wisdom lives as much in weathered hands as in trained \nones, that\n the profound often emerges from the prosaic. Art, in our vision, becomes less about eleva\ntion and more about recognition, \nseeing the choreography already present in daily life, the compositions already formed in humble acts of care and craft.\nIn this space where curiosity meets creation, complexity finds its antidote not in simplification but in the simple act of paying attention. Here, art returns to its most essential function: making the act of living itself a conscious, deliberate, beautiful thing.\nRepertoire:\nWe in\nhabit the fractures of our time, \nmapping the terrain where modernity's promises collide with its devastations, where progress and erosion dance their complex duet. Through the language of the body, we excavate the contemporary moment: its accelerations and ruptures, its luminous possibilities and shadowed costs.\nOur physical vocabulary emerges from the confluence \nof inherited and invented forms, \nwhere the crystallized wisdom of classical traditions and the earthy intelligence of folk practices meet the fluid innovations of contemporary movement, forging a kinetic language elastic enough to contain the multiplicity of modern experience.\nIn this synthesis of old wisdom and new urgency, the body becomes both witness and testimony. Each gesture carries the weight of collective experience: the velocity of urban existence, the fragmentation of digital connection, the persistent ache of disconnection from natural rhythms. We move through these tensions not to resolve them, but to make them visible, to give form to the formless anxieties that define our epoch.\nHere, dance and theatre conve\nrge as archaeology, \nunearthing the buried truths of how we live now, how we've learned to move through a world that moves too fast, how we maintain our humanity within systems that often forget it. Our work is both mirror and map: reflecting what is, while charting pathways toward what might yet be possible.\nScreen dance:\nFilm offers movement a seco\nnd life, \ncapturing the ephemeral and suspending it in time, allowing the fleeting gesture to be revisited, reconsidered, \nre\n-\nexperienced. Through this lens, our explorations of modernity's complexities find new dimensions: the camera can hold the microscopic tremor of uncertainty, the macro sweep of collective transformation, the interplay between the performed and the spontaneously human.\nThese screen works carry forward the same archaeological impulse that \ndrives our stage investigations, \nexcavating contemporary experience through embodied inquiry. Yet the cinematic medium allows us to burrow deeper into the individual psyche while simultaneously expanding into landscapes both literal and metaphorical. Movement here becomes both subject and sentence, both question and punctuation in the ongoing dialogue between tradition and innovation.\nWhether serving the narrative arc of feature cinema or pursuing the pure poetry of artistic film, each piece maintains our commitment to making visible the invisible choreographies that govern modern existen\nce. The screen becomes a portal, \nnot merely documenting dance, but revealing how dance documentation itself becomes a form of contemporary witness, a way of preserving the fleeting truths that bodies tell in motion.
